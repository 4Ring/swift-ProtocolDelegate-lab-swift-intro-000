## Outline / Notes

*  I've included an Xcode lab in this project which includes the Quick & Nimble testing frameworks. Use the .xcworkspace file.
* There should be a solutionWIP branch that won't be merged into anything. It will leave by its lonesome for me to review.
* There should be your own branch (named whatever you like) that will not include the solution in Xcode, it will be what the student is cloning down and working through. It should include tests (similar to the prior labs on how to write them).
* The idea I have in mind for this lab is having them pass something back to the prior ViewController in a shopping cart app they have to create.
* The first VC will be the second VC. The first VC has a display of shopping items that can be edited in the second VC (either more items, diff. name, or something like that) where the update will persist (be updated to the original item passed back to the first VC).
* I like the idea of it being number or quanity of items that oucld be changed in the second VC which wil update and reflect back to the first VC in the tableviewcell.
